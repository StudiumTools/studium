## FAQ

#### Is there anything you can add?

Yes, A lot! That is why you should look in our last section: Support, so that you can tell us what we are missing - and we can think and implement what-ever you would like!

#### Can I host this?

I don't know about places like WAMP, but I know you can host it on XAMPP - please refer to the section: "Run Locally" if you would like to do that - but I would prefer you refer to a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no).

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS

**Server:** JavaScript (partially)


## Documentation

- This would be most of the Documentation that you could need but if you would like to refer to any more - you can at:

## API Reference

This is a very surface level project - it should not need any outside API, maybe FontAwsome or heroIcon API(s) therefore requiring the internet but without the internet
it can still be used but you will lose some very nice quality-of-life improvements like icons.
